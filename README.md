Title: LMul: A Low-Precision Transformer Language Model
Abstract: This paper presents LMul, a transformer-based language model that utilizes low-precision arithmetic to reduce computational and memory requirements. By representing weights and activations using a limited number of mantissa bits, LMul achieves comparable performance to full-precision models while offering potential efficiency gains. We describe the architecture and training process of LMul and demonstrate its effectiveness on a small-scale text generation task.
Introduction Language models have made significant advancements in recent years, with transformer-based architectures like BERT and GPT showing impressive results on various natural language processing tasks. However, these models often require substantial computational resources and memory due to their large number of parameters and floating-point operations. Low-precision arithmetic has emerged as a promising approach to reduce the computational and memory footprint of deep learning models. In this paper, we introduce LMul, a transformer-based language model that leverages low-precision arithmetic to improve efficiency while maintaining performance.
Related Work Several studies have explored the use of low-precision arithmetic in deep learning models. [Citations needed] These works have demonstrated that models can maintain accuracy even when weights and activations are represented with reduced precision. In the domain of language modeling, [Citations needed] have applied low-precision techniques to transformer-based architectures, showing promising results.
LMul Architecture LMul follows a standard transformer architecture, consisting of an embedding layer, positional encoding, multiple transformer blocks, and an output layer. The key difference lies in the use of low-precision arithmetic for the linear layers and attention mechanisms. We introduce the LMulLinear and LMulMultiHeadAttention modules, which perform matrix multiplications using a limited number of mantissa bits. By quantizing the weights and activations, we reduce the memory footprint and computational complexity of the model.
Training and Evaluation We train LMul on a small-scale text dataset using the cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer. The model is trained for a fixed number of epochs, and the average loss is reported for each epoch. To evaluate the model's performance, we generate text by providing a prompt and iteratively predicting the next token until a maximum length is reached. The generated text is then compared to the original prompt to assess the model's language generation capabilities.
Results and Discussion Our experiments demonstrate that LMul can generate coherent and relevant text given a prompt, even with the use of low-precision arithmetic. While the model's performance may not match that of full-precision models on larger datasets, it serves as a proof-of-concept for the potential of low-precision language modeling. Further optimizations and scaling to larger datasets could yield more impressive results.
Conclusion and Future Work In this paper, we introduced LMul, a transformer-based language model that utilizes low-precision arithmetic to improve efficiency. Our initial experiments show promising results, indicating the feasibility of low-precision language modeling. Future work could explore more advanced quantization techniques, larger-scale training, and the application of LMul to various natural language processing tasks.
